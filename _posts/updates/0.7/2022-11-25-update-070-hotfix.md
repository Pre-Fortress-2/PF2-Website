## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where some of the pipebombs from the Pipebomb Launcher wouldn't disappear upon death
- Slightly buffed Medigun heal rate (12 health per second -> 18 health per second)
- Fixed a bug where the Medigun detach sound would play if you pressed primary fire without healing anyone
- Fixed a visual bug where the Pipebomb Launcher's reload animation would show a stray pipebomb at higher viewmodel FOVs
- Fixed a case where fully charging the Pipebomb Launcher's pipebombs would have it disappear
- Fixed a bug where aiming with the Sniper Rifle while teleporting would enable the scope overlay while not zoomed in
- Fixed a bug where you could see the enemy's glow while they're holding the flag
- Fixed a bug where Medic's Heal grenade could heal/infect people through walls
- Fixed being able to haul a building while priming a grenade 
- Fixed the Tranquilizer Gun not taking ammo away from reserve ammo if it was passively reloaded

- Fixed the Übercharge overlay on DX8
