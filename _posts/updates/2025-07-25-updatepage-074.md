            The PF2 Team has been hard at work wrapping up a lovely lineup of gifts and surprises for the holiday season!<br>From mild festivities to new horizons, we've got plenty in store for you! Yes sir, we were feeling proud of ourselves… until one of our interns— (looking at you, H. Gregg) —finally decided to flip the calendar. Turns out, it’s <strong>Christmas in July!</strong> Yep, you heard that right! We were so caught up in this bizarre cold snap that we completely lost track of time. That damned hole in the ozone has made things so frigid here at HQ that we didn’t realize the seasons had changed... twice. Don’t worry though, we’re still ready to spread some holiday cheer, even if it’s a bit ahead of schedule!

                Along the many branches of the Chicago River, lies the Canalzone Shipping Complex, a major hub that connects the Midwest to global trade. <br>Or at least, it used to be.<br>These days, it’s become the latest battleground between the world's best worst control freaks. RED’s making a hard push to lock down rail lines and inland routes, while BLU’s focused on seizing control of docks and maritime operations.<br>The result?<br><strong>A full-blown logistics nightmare.</strong><br> Now trade is stuck right in the middle of their mess, and it’s anyone’s guess if anything will move any time soon.

                Domination kicks off with neutral control points scattered across the map. Each owned point earns your team 1 point per second!<br>The more territory you control, the faster your score increases! Whichever team reaches the score limit first wins!<br> But beware, the center control point awards <strong>double</strong> points, making it a high-stakes target. Stay sharp and defend your ground. One mistake could turn the tide!

            Amid a relentless blizzard in the remote Pacific Northwest, the ruins of an abandoned mining town lie buried beneath the snow.<br> At its heart stands a colossal, frost-covered cathedral. Once a place of worship, it now conceals something far more sinister.<br> Inside, RED and BLU have each claimed separate parts of the cathedral for their own secret nuclear superweapon research, completely oblivious to the other’s presence.<br> Upon the very obvious discovery, they scrambled to secure their reactor codes. However, they soon found themselves trapped by the bitter cold of the storm. <br>Now, both teams remain locked in a deadly standoff as the snow howls outside, reactors hum below, and the mercs struggle to ensure that they keep control of the super-lasers that loom above.

            A mysterious cold front has swept across the Southwest, from the Mojave to the Chihuahuan, hitting Teufort, New Mexico, hardest of all. The arid heat that our favorite uniformed lunatics are typically familiar with has been swept out from under them somehow... in the middle of summer? With teeth chattering and no snow gear in sight, these gunmen aren’t getting paid to freeze to death. So, just like in the good ol' days on the Western Front, our mercenaries briefly ceased hostilities, made snow angels, sipped hot cocoa, and even built snowmen together.<br>But, like the completely reasonable and responsible psychopaths they are, it wasn’t long before they went back to their old ways, rigging their snowmen with deadly explosives! Because why let a blizzard get in the way of a good explosion?

                We would like to take a moment to express our sincere gratitude to each and every one of you for your incredible patience and unwavering support. We know it’s been a long and sometimes bumpy road, and we truly appreciate you sticking with us through the highs, the lows, and everything in between. Big things are on the horizon, and while we wish we could show you everything right now, we still have much to work on. Soon we'll be back to wrestling with bugs, nightly caffeine shortages, and the occasional "Oops, forgot to commit that file to the sources." But have faith, the wait will be more than worth it.<br><br>And before we forget, yes, we’ve finally fired H. Gregg. That'll teach him not to touch the damn calendar EVER again. Lesson learned. Thanks again for being part of the journey, and stay tuned. There’s much more to come!
