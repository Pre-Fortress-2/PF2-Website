## Additions
- Added the event "grenade_self_explosion"
- Added the input ``InputSetDomScale`` to ``team_control_point``
- Backported ``tf_glow``, ``filter_tf_player_can_cap``, and ``filter_tf_damaged_by_weapon_in_slot`` from the SDK
- Added ``filter_pf_weapon_type_damage``, which allows you to filter damage by weapon type

## Changes
- Updated grenade bounding boxes to be more accurate to their world models
- Updated the Bear Traps to have more uniform deviation
- Updated max grenade impact damage to 10 damage (from 2 damage).
- Removed the output ``OnThrow`` from ``item_teamflag`` as ``OnDrop`` does the same thing
- ``pf_grenade_holstering`` is now a command that applies on game restart
- ``mp_restartround`` is no longer a cheat command
- ``tf_max_voice_speak_delay`` is no longer a developer command
- Updated the unassigned text color to gray (from white)
- Updated Spywalk UI elements
