excerpt: "Updates to the current version of Pre Fortress 2."
---

## Additions
- Added the event "grenade_self_explosion", which is fired if players let grenades explode in their hands
- Added the input ``InputSetDomScale`` to ``team_control_point``

## Changes
- Updated grenade bounding boxes to be more accurate to their world models
- Updated the Bear Traps to have more uniform random deviation
- Updated max grenade impact damage to 10 damage (from 2 damage).
- Removed the output ``OnThrow`` from ``item_teamflag`` as ``OnDrop`` does the same thing
- ``pf_grenade_holstering`` is now a command that applies on game restart
- ``mp_restartround`` is no longer a cheat command
- Updated the unassigned text color to gray (from white)
- Updated the Spywalk HUD panel

## Bug Fixes
---
- Fixed a visual bug where grenade animations would fail to load the player's viewmodel arms

- Fixed grenades stalling their detonation time until you can attack
- Fixed grenade deploying and throwing sounds playing erroneously and unreliably
- Fixed grenades under ``pf_grenade_holstering 0`` not being able to be thrown while reloading, aiming in with the Sniper Rifle, charging a weapon, or revved up with the Minigun
- Fixed third person grenade animations breaking posing for third person weapon animations
- Fixed an oversight that allowed you to attack while unholstering
- Fixed an oversight that allowed you to throw grenades with either grenade button
- Fixed the ``item_teamflag`` outputs ``OnDropTeam1`` and ``OnDropTeam2`` not firing
- Fixed a bug where self grenade damage resistance wasn't properly applying to players
- Fixed the ``entity_backpack`` entity not being able to spawn in maps
- Fixed a visual bug with the Defense Turret's freeze cam showing out of bounds
