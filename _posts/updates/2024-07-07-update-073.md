## Balance Changes 
---
- ### General
	- Adjusted how explosive radius damage is calculated
	- Weapon deploy speed is now 0.5 seconds (from 0.66 seconds). Animation speed has not been changed.
	- Grenades no longer have a self damage cap at 50 health
	
- ### Scout
	- #### Class
		- Armor increased to 50 (from 25)
	- #### Bear Traps
		- Reduced the deploy time to 0.6 seconds (from 0.8 seconds)
		
- ### Soldier
	- #### Class
		- Armor decreased to 125 (from 150)
		- Self rocket blast damage resistance increased to 40% (from 20%)
		- Self rocket blast damage resistance no longer applies if damage was also inflicted on an enemy 
		- Changed rocket jumping to feel more like Live TF2
	- #### Nail Grenade
		- Tripled the nail deploy time 

- ### Pyro
	- #### Flamethrower
		- Increased base primary damage to 180 (from 170)
		- Increased the flame rocket's projectile speed to 850 HU/s (from 750 HU/s)
		- Increased the flame rocket's base damage to 25 (from 20)
		- Decreased the flame rocket's radius to 100 HU (from 150 HU)
		
- ### Demoman
	- #### Class
		- Self pipebomb blast damage resistance increased to 25% (from 20%)
		- Self pipebomb blast damage resistance no longer applies if damage was also inflicted on an enemy 
		
- ### Engineer
	- #### Class
		- Health increased to 90 (from 80)
		- Added armor regeneration. Works similar to Medic's health regeneration: You will now regenerate at a rate of 1-3 armor every three seconds depending on how long it's been since you've last been hit.
		
- ### Medic
	- #### Medigun
		- The medigun speed buff, which allowed you to run at Scout's speed while healing him, is disabled by default
		
- ### Sniper
	- #### Sniper Rifle
		- You can no longer shoot while jumping; you can still shoot in the air if it wasn't initiated by a jump
		
- ### Spy
	- #### Class
		- Added Spywalking, a mechanic which allows you to use Spy's normal walking speed if you're disguised as a slower class. Holding down the Spywalk button while disguised will allow you to travel at the Spy's normal walking speed as a slower class. It is bound to Shift by default. You may have to bind the key after updating the game.
		- Disguising calculations are simpler; instead of faking a random health and armor value if a viable disguise target isn't available, the max health and armor for the disguised class will be faked instead.
		- Disguised Spies can now fake Medic Übercharge values
		- The voice status bubble no longer appears above your player if you are disguised or invisible
	- #### Gas Grenade
		- Increased the damage to 14 (from 8)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where voice commands were disabled by default in the chat window, despite the filter in the chat window showing otherwise
- Fixed a bug where pipebombs in the air could be pushed by other explosives
- Fixed many issues with the talker scripts, response rules, and scene files so classes are a lot more talkative

## Commands
---
- Added the command ``pf_change_text_color`` which controls the color of the chat text in-game. 0 is the original text color, 1 is the white text color.

- The commands listed above are also located in the Advanced Options menu
- Added support for the command ``sv_pure`` so that only official PF2 content can be used on the server. Still set to 0 by default.
- Added back the command ``pf_picmip``, which will let you adjust your texture settings from -10 to 10 again
- Renamed the command ``pf_healthkit_armor_repair`` to ``pf_armor_healthkit_repair``
- Renamed the command ``pf_ammokit_grenades`` to ``pf_grenade_ammokits_dispense``
