The Steam Page is fully primed and Pre-Fortress 2 is all in on porting to the TF2 SDK!

While you wait for 0.8 make sure to check out our Cold Snap update we released on our website last month!

Pre-Fortress 2 version 0.7.4 "Cold Snap" will be the last version of PF2 available to download from our website. All future releases will be available right from the Steam store!

We were still developing version 0.7.4 when the TF2 SDK released and wanted to put our efforts into finishing it before we released the Steam page. We thank you for your patience!
